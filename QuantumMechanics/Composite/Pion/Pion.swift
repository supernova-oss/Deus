/// ``Meson`` composed by ``Quark``-antiquark pairs, produced most commonly via high-energy
/// collisions between ``Hadron``s and specific ``Particle``-antiparticle annihilation.
///
/// ## Etimology
///
/// Its name ("π meson", contracted to "pion") was defined by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 and is
/// indicative of its then-theorized role as a carrier ``Particle`` of strong force, inspired by the
/// visual resemblance between "π" and "介", Kanji that means "to mediate".
///
/// Later, in 1962, Murray Gell-Mann theorized that such force was, rather, mediated by gluons,
/// massless ``Particle``s whose ``Spin`` is 1 *ħ* and which are, consequently, categorized as
/// vector bosons.
///
/// ## Stability
///
/// Because of their lightness, the lifetime of pions is extremely short, resulting in them lasting
/// from 85 attoseconds to ~26.033 ns before their decay into muons and neutrinos (π⁺ → μ + v) or
/// into gamma rays. Therefore, they are considered **unstable**.
